= Feathers TypeScript Starter


This repository is a simple template of a
link:http://feathersjs.com[FeathersJS] application using
link:https://typescriptlang.org[TypeScript].

It includes the things which **I** find to be terribly useful and serves as a
template for rapidly building out applications
